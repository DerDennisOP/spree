<Tooltip tip="">The Vendors tab, and therefore the ability to invite and manage vendors, is only available in Spree Enterprise Edition.</Tooltip>

If you're running a marketplace, then the ability to invite vendors is an essential part of launching and scaling your platform.

By default, vendors must be invited to start selling on the marketplace. If you're interested in vendor self-signup, then please reach out to us directly.

## Navigate to Vendors Tab

To invite a vendor, navigate to the Vendors tab of the admin dashboard.

![4.1.1 Invite A Vendor - Navigate To Tab.png](/docs/images/4.1.1InviteAVendor-NavigateToTab.png)

Here you would usually see a list of all the vendors that have been invited or are already onboarded to the marketplace, but for now it will be blank since you first need to invite some vendors.

## Click "Invite Vendor"

Click on "Invite Vendor" in the top right corner and a popup will appear.

You must fill in the following fields:

- **Company Name or Brand Name** - this is how the vendor will be displayed in the admin dashboard (if they onboard using Shopify, may be overwritten)
- **Contact Person Email** - preferably the work email address of the person who should receive the invitation
- **Commission Rate** - the pre-agreed commission rate to be shared with the marketplace

<Tooltip tip="">The commission rate can be different for each vendor and also updated at a later time.</Tooltip>

## Send Invitation

Double check that you've added all of the information correctly, and then click "Sent Invitation".

The newly invited vendor will now be added to your list of vendors.

The vendor will receive an email invitation to the specified email address where they can begin the self-service onboarding process.

### Alternative Method

If, for some reason, the vendor didn't receive the email, or they prefer to use a different channel of communication, you can send them a copy of the invitation link instead.

To do so, click on the vendor to open up their vendor profile.

![4.1.4 Invite A Vendor - Vendor Profile.png](/docs/images/4.1.4InviteAVendor-VendorProfile.png)

Click on "More actions" in the top right corner and select "Copy invitation link" from the dropdown menu.

### Cancel Invitation

If, for whatever reason, you decide to terminate your partnership with the vendor before they start the onboarding process, you can cancel their invitation to block their access to the platform.

Simply click "More actions" in the top right corner of their vendor profile and select "Cancel Invitation" from the dropdown menu.

## Next Steps

Now that the invitation has been sent, you can sit back and relax while the vendor completes the guided, self-service onboarding process.

If you'd like to see what the vendor onboarding process looks like, or if a vendor is asking for onboarding support, please refer to the Vendor Onboarding support article.
